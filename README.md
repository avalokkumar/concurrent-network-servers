### Concurrent network servers are a common way to handle multiple client connections simultaneously in network programming.

#### Examples of popular concurrency models

* **Thread-per-client model:** In this model, each client connection is handled in its own thread. The server creates a new thread for each client connection, and each thread handles the communication with its corresponding client. This model is simple to implement, but it can be resource-intensive if the server has to handle many concurrent connections.

* **Event-driven model:** In this model, the server uses a single thread to handle multiple client connections. The server waits for incoming connections and I/O events, and dispatches events to the appropriate event handler functions. This model can be more efficient than the thread-per-client model, but it can be more complex to implement.

* **Actor model:** In this model, each client connection is handled by an actor, which is a lightweight process that communicates with other actors through message passing. Actors can be used to handle incoming messages from clients, process them, and send responses back to the client. This model can be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, but it can be more complex to implement than the thread-per-client model.

* **Thread pool model:** In this model, the server creates a fixed number of worker threads in a thread pool. Each worker thread handles one client connection at a time, and when a client connection is completed, the worker thread is returned to the pool to be reused. This model can be more efficient than the thread-per-client model, and it can scale well as long as the number of worker threads is set appropriately.
