### Thread pool model

* In the Thread pool model, a fixed number of threads are created ahead of time and are kept alive for the duration of the program.
* When a client request comes in, a task is created to handle the request and is added to a queue.
* One of the available threads in the pool is assigned to pick up a task from the queue and handle it.
* Once a thread is done handling a task, it goes back to the queue to pick up another task if there is one available.
* If all threads in the pool are currently busy, any new incoming tasks are placed in the queue to wait until a thread is available to handle them.
* The number of threads in the pool is usually chosen based on the number of available processors or cores on the machine running the program, as having more threads than available processors can actually degrade performance due to context switching overhead.
* Thread pools can be used in a variety of server applications, such as web servers, database servers, and game servers.
* Thread pools can improve performance and scalability in server applications, as they allow for better utilization of available resources and can handle a larger number of client requests simultaneously.

#### Examples of Thread pool model

* > **Apache Tomcat:** An open source web server and servlet container that uses a thread pool to handle incoming requests from clients.
* > **Hadoop MapReduce:** A framework for distributed processing of large data sets that uses a thread pool to execute map and reduce tasks in parallel across a cluster of nodes.
* > **Java Executor Framework:** A built-in Java API for managing thread pools that provides a flexible and scalable way to execute tasks asynchronously in a multithreaded environment.
* > **Spring Framework:** A popular Java-based framework for building web applications that includes support for thread pooling through its TaskExecutor abstraction.
* > **Apache MINA:** A high-performance networking framework for building scalable network applications that uses a thread pool to handle client connections and I/O operations.
* > **Akka:** A toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems that use the Actor model and a thread pool to manage and execute actors.

**Note**
The Thread pool model is used to improve the scalability and efficiency of handling multiple requests or tasks in a concurrent environment. By creating a fixed or dynamic pool of threads, these systems can manage the resources required to handle incoming requests, balance the workload across available threads, and avoid the overhead of creating and destroying threads for every task.
